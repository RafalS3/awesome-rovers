Kalman is one of two planetary rovers built by [AGH Space Systems](https://spacesystems.agh.edu.pl/), following the earlier [Phobos](##phobos) model with advanced new technical solutions. This agile, four-wheeled research vehicle features vision systems for remote control and terrain documentation. Itâ€™s equipped with a manipulator for handling objects, performing basic repairs, and operating control panels, as well as a mobile lab for soil sample analysis.
