- Connected to the lander by a 15-meter power cable.
- Equipped with two small metal rods for autonomous obstacle avoidance.
- Built 26 years before NASA's first rover in 1997.
- Two PrOP-M rovers were built for Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions (possibly more for further missions).
- After landing, meant to be placed on the Martian surface by a 6-joint robotic arm, moving within the view of the lander’s cameras.
- Carried two instruments, a dynamic penetrometer and a gamma-ray densitometer.
- Their tracks in the Martian soil would have helped analyze the soil’s material properties.
